# Mysterium
<br>
``What Mysterium is ?``<br>
**Mysterium is a tool which allows you to retrieve the most part of a Python code even if it is encrypted or obfuscated, even with Pyarmor or .pyc it works perfectly.**<br>
<br>
``How to use :``<br>
**It depends what you want to inspect, but if you want to inspect a py or pyc file you only have to drag it into Mysterium.**<br>
**If what you want is to inspect a file obfuscated under Pyarmor, you have to zip the code.py and the pytransform folder, and after that you have to drag the zip file into Mysterium.**<br>
